# Sign-in

You can sign-in to your team from the web address of `https://domain.com/teamname`. 

There are several options for signing in depending on how your System Administrator has configured your server. 

#### Email address and password sign-in

If available, you can sign in using the combination of email address and password used to create your account. 

If you have forgotten your password, you should be able to reset it from the "I forgot my password" option on the sign-in screen, or contact your System Administrator if you need help resetting your password. 

#### GitLab Single-Sign-On (SSO) option 

If available, you can sign in using your GitLab account using a one-click sign-in option. GitLab SSO lets you create teams, create accounts on teams, and sign-in to teams using one username, email address and password that works across everything on the server. 

#### Switching Teams

You can switch among teams you've recently signed into using the main menu in any team site on the server. By default, devices remember which teams you have signed into for 30 days, and this duration is configurable by the System Administrator.
