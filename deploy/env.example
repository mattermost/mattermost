# Nginx
## The nginx container will use a configuration found at the NGINX_MATTERMOST_CONFIG. The config aims
## to be secure and uses a catch-all server vhost which will work out-of-the-box. For additional settings
## or changes ones can edit it or provide another config. Important note: inside the container, nginx sources
## every config file inside */etc/nginx/conf.d* ending with a *.conf* file extension.

## Inside the container the uid and gid is 101. The folder owner can be set with
## `sudo chown -R 101:101 ./nginx` if needed.
## Note that this repository requires nginx version 1.25.1 or later
NGINX_IMAGE_TAG=alpine

## The folder containing server blocks and any additional config to nginx.conf
NGINX_CONFIG_PATH=./nginx/conf.d

# Mattermost settings
## Inside the container the uid and gid is 2000. The folder owner can be set with
## `sudo chown -R 2000:2000 ./volumes/app/mattermost`.

## This will be 'mattermost-enterprise-edition' or 'mattermost-team-edition' based on the version of Mattermost you're installing.
MATTERMOST_IMAGE=mattermost-enterprise-edition
## Update the image tag if you want to upgrade your Mattermost version. You may also upgrade to the latest one. The example is based on the latest Mattermost ESR version.
MATTERMOST_IMAGE_TAG=10.5.2

## Make Mattermost container readonly. This interferes with the regeneration of root.html inside the container. Only use
## it if you know what you're doing.
## See https://github.com/mattermost/docker/issues/18
MATTERMOST_CONTAINER_READONLY=false

## The app port is only relevant for using Mattermost without the nginx container as reverse proxy. This is not meant
## to be used with the internal HTTP server exposed but rather in case one wants to host several services on one host
## or for using it behind another existing reverse proxy.
APP_PORT=8065

## Configuration settings for Mattermost. Documentation on the variables and the settings itself can be found at
## https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html
## Keep in mind that variables set here will take precedence over the same setting in config.json. This includes
## the system console as well and settings set with env variables will be greyed out.

## Below one can find necessary settings to spin up the Mattermost container
MM_SQLSETTINGS_DRIVERNAME=postgres
MM_SQLSETTINGS_DATASOURCE=postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}?sslmode=disable&connect_timeout=10

## Example settings (any additional setting added here also needs to be introduced in the docker-compose.yml)
MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=https://${DOMAIN}
