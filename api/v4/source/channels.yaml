        Archives a channel. This will set the `deleteAt` to the current timestamp in the database. Soft deleted channels may not be accessible in the user
        interface. They can be viewed and unarchived in the **System Console > User Management > Channels** based on your license. Direct and group message channels cannot be deleted.


        As of server version 5.28, optionally use the `permanent=true` query parameter to permanently delete the channel for compliance reasons. To use this feature `ServiceSettings.EnableAPIChannelDeletion` must be set to `true` in the server's configuration. 
        If you permanently delete a channel this action is not recoverable outside of a database backup.

        `delete_public_channel` permission if the channel is public,

        `delete_private_channel` permission if the channel is private,
