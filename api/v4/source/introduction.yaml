  - name: schema
    description: >
      All API access is through HTTP(S) requests at
      `your-mattermost-url.com/api/v4`. All request and response bodies are
      `application/json`.


      When using endpoints that require a user id, the string `me` can be used in place of the user id to indicate the action is to be taken for the logged in user.


      For all endpoints that implement pagination via the `per_page` parameter, the maximum number of items returned per request is capped at 200. If `per_page` exceeds 200, the list will be silently truncated to 200 items.
  - name: drivers
    description: >
      The easiest way to interact with the Mattermost Web Service API is through
      a language specific driver.


      #### Official Drivers

      * Mattermost JavaScript/TypeScript Driver

  - name: authentication
    description: >
      There are multiple ways to authenticate against the Mattermost API.


      All examples assume there is a Mattermost instance running at http://localhost:8065.


      #### Session Token


      Make an HTTP POST to `your-mattermost-url.com/api/v4/users/login` with a JSON body indicating the userâ€™s `login_id`, `password` and optionally the MFA `token`. The `login_id` can be an email, username or an AD/LDAP ID depending on the system's configuration.


      ```

      curl -i -d '{"login_id":"someone@nowhere.com","password":"thisisabadpassword"}' http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/login

      ```


      NOTE: If you're running cURL on windows, you will have to change the single quotes to double quotes, and escape the inner double quotes with backslash, like below:


      ```

      curl -i -d "{\"login_id\":\"someone@nowhere.com\",\"password\":\"thisisabadpassword\"}" http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/login

      ```


      If successful, the response will contain a `Token` header and a user object in the body.


      ```

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      Set-Cookie: MMSID=hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso; Path=/; Max-Age=2592000; HttpOnly

      Token: hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso

      X-Ratelimit-Limit: 10

      X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 9

      X-Ratelimit-Reset: 1

      X-Request-Id: smda55ckcfy89b6tia58shk5fh

      X-Version-Id: developer

      Date: Fri, 11 Sep 2015 13:21:14 GMT

      Content-Length: 657

      Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8


      {{user object as json}}

      ```


      Include the `Token` as part of the `Authorization` header on your future API requests with the `Bearer` method.


      ```

      curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer hyr5dmb1mbb49c44qmx4whniso' http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/me

      ```


      You should now be able to access the API as the user you logged in as.


      #### Personal Access Tokens


      Using [personal access tokens](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html) is very similar to using a session token. The only real difference is that session tokens will expire, while personal access tokens will live until they are manually revoked by the user or an admin.


      Just like session tokens, include the personal access token as part of the `Authorization` header in your requests using the `Bearer` method. Assuming our personal access token is `9xuqwrwgstrb3mzrxb83nb357a`, we could use it as shown below.


      ```

      curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer 9xuqwrwgstrb3mzrxb83nb357a' http://localhost:8065/api/v4/users/me

      ```


      #### OAuth 2.0


      Mattermost has the ability to act as an [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) service provider.


      The official documentation for [using your Mattermost server as an OAuth 2.0 service provider can be found here.](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/oauth-2-0-applications.html)


      For an example on how to register an OAuth 2.0 app with your Mattermost instance, please see the [Mattermost-Zapier integration documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/zapier.html#register-zapier-as-an-oauth-2-0-application).
  - name: errors
    description: >
      All errors will return an appropriate HTTP response code along with the
      following JSON body:

      ```

      {
          "id": "the.error.id",
          "message": "Something went wrong", // the reason for the error
          "request_id": "", // the ID of the request
          "status_code": 0, // the HTTP status code
          "is_oauth": false // whether the error is OAuth specific
      }

      ```
  - name: rate limiting
    description: >
      Whenever you make an HTTP request to the Mattermost API you might notice
      the following headers included in the response:

      ```

      X-Ratelimit-Limit: 10

      X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 9

      X-Ratelimit-Reset: 1441983590

      ```


      These headers are telling you your current rate limit status.


      | Header | Description |

      | ------ | ----------- |

      | X-Ratelimit-Limit | The maximum number of requests you can make per second. |

      | X-Ratelimit-Remaining | The number of requests remaining in the current window. |

      | X-Ratelimit-Reset | The remaining UTC epoch seconds before the rate limit resets. |


      If you exceed your rate limit for a window you will receive the following error in the body of the response:


      ```

      HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests

      Date: Tue, 10 Sep 2015 11:20:28 GMT

      X-RateLimit-Limit: 10

      X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0

      X-RateLimit-Reset: 1


      limit exceeded

      ```
  - name: WebSocket
    description: >
      In addition to the HTTP RESTful web service, Mattermost also offers a
      WebSocket event delivery system and some API functionality.


      To connect to the WebSocket follow the standard opening handshake as [defined by the RFC specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.3) to the `/api/v4/websocket` endpoint of Mattermost.


      #### Authentication


      The Mattermost WebSocket can be authenticated using [the standard API authentication methods](/#tag/authentication) (by a cookie or with an explicit Authorization header) or through an authentication challenge. If you're authenticating from a browser and have logged in with the Mattermost API, your authentication cookie should already be set. This is how the Mattermost webapp authenticates with the WebSocket.


      To authenticate with an authentication challenge, first connect the WebSocket and then send the following JSON over the connection:


      ```

      {
        "seq": 1,
        "action": "authentication_challenge",
        "data": {
          "token": "mattermosttokengoeshere"
        }
      }

      ```


      If successful, you will receive a standard OK response over the WebSocket connection:


      ```

      {
        "status": "OK",
        "seq_reply": 1
      }

      ```


      Once successfully authenticated, the server will pass a `hello` WebSocket event containing server version over the connection.


      #### Events


      WebSocket events are primarily used to alert the client to changes in Mattermost, such as delivering new posts or alerting the client that another user is typing in a channel.


      Events on the WebSocket will have the form:


      ```

      {
        "event": "hello",
        "data": {
          "server_version": "3.6.0.1451.1c38da627ebb4e3635677db6939e9195"
        },
        "broadcast":{
          "omit_users": null,
          "user_id": "ay5sq51sebfh58ktrce5ijtcwy",
          "channel_id": "",
          "team_id": ""
        },
        "seq": 0
      }

      ```


      The `event` field indicates the event type, `data` contains any data relevant to the event and `broadcast` contains information about who the event was sent to. For example, the above example has `user_id` set to "ay5sq51sebfh58ktrce5ijtcwy" meaning that only the user with that ID received this event broadcast. The `omit_users` field can contain an array of user IDs that were specifically omitted from receiving the event.


      The list of Mattermost WebSocket events are:

      - added_to_team

      - authentication_challenge

      - channel_converted

      - channel_created

      - channel_deleted

      - channel_member_updated

      - channel_updated

      - channel_viewed

      - config_changed

      - delete_team

      - direct_added

      - emoji_added

      - ephemeral_message

      - group_added

      - hello

      - leave_team

      - license_changed

      - memberrole_updated

      - new_user

      - reaction_removed

      - response

      - role_updated

      - status_change

      - typing

      - update_team

      - user_added

      - user_removed

      - user_role_updated

      - user_updated

      - dialog_opened

      - thread_updated

      - thread_follow_changed

      - thread_read_changed


      #### WebSocket API


      Mattermost has some basic support for WebSocket APIs. A connected WebSocket can make requests by sending the following over the connection:


      ```

      {
        "action": "user_typing",
        "seq": 2,
        "data": {
          "channel_id": "nhze199c4j87ped4wannrjdt9c",
          "parent_id": ""
        }
      }

      ```


      This is an example of making a `user_typing` request, with the purpose of alerting the server that the connected client has begun typing in a channel or thread. The `action` field indicates what is being requested, and performs a similar duty as the route in a HTTP API. The `data` field is used to add any additional data along with the request. The server supports binary websocket messages as well in case the client has such a requirement.


      The `seq` or sequence number is set by the client and should be incremented with every use. It is used to distinguish responses to requests that come down the WebSocket. For example, a standard response to the above request would be:


      ```

      {
        "status": "OK",
        "seq_reply": 2
      }

      ```


      Notice `seq_reply` is 2, matching the `seq` of the original request. Using this a client can distinguish which request the response is meant for.


      If there was any information to respond with, it would be encapsulated in a `data` field.


      In the case of an error, the response would be:


      ```

      {
        "status": "FAIL",
        "seq_reply": 2,
        "error": {
          "id": "some.error.id.here",
          "message": "Some error message here"
        }
      }

      ```


      The list of WebSocket API actions is:

      - user_typing

      - get_statuses

      - get_statuses_by_ids


      To see how these actions work, please refer to either the [Golang WebSocket driver](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/server/public/model/websocket_client.go) or our [JavaScript WebSocket driver](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/webapp/platform/client/src/websocket.ts).
  - name: common parameters
    description: >
      - `per_page`: For paged APIs, the number of items to return per page.

        The maximum number of items returned per request is capped at 200. If `per_page` exceeds 200, the list will be silently truncated to 200 items.

        If a paged API requires a `per_page` parameter and it is not provided, the default value is 60.
