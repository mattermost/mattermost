    # Some cache implementations use md5 hashes for cached filenames.  There is
    # a slight risk of cache poisoning if an attacker could construct a URL
    # with the same hash, but it would also need to be allowed by the proxies
    # security settings.  Changing these to a more secure hash algorithm would
    # result in 100% cache misses when users upgrade. For now, just leave these
    # alone.
