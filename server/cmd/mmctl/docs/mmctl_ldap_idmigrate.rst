mmctl ldap idmigrate
--------------------

Migrate LDAP IdAttribute to new value

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~


Migrate LDAP "IdAttribute" to a new value. Run this utility to change the value of your ID Attribute without your users losing their accounts. After running the command you can change the ID Attribute to the new value in the System Console. For example, if your current ID Attribute was "sAMAccountName" and you wanted to change it to "objectGUID", you would:

1. Wait for an off-peak time when your users wonâ€™t be impacted by a server restart.
2. Run the command "mmctl ldap idmigrate objectGUID".
3. Update the config within the System Console to the new value "objectGUID".
4. Restart the Mattermost server.
