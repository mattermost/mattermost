## Remote Cluster Service

Package `remotecluster` implements Mattermost's "Secured Connections" feature, which enables communication between different Mattermost clusters. Specifically, this package provides:

 ### Service Management:

- Manages inter-cluster communication via topic-based messages
- Handles connection state (active/inactive) based on cluster leadership
- Maintains concurrent send channels (MaxConcurrentSends = 10) for parallel message processing
- Implements periodic health checks (pings) to monitor remote cluster connectivity

 ### Message Handling:

- Sends messages using a pool of goroutines to handle concurrent sends while preserving message order per remote
- Uses hash-based routing to ensure messages for the same remote ID go to the same channel
- Supports different types of sends: messages, files, and profile images
- Implements topic-based message routing with listener callbacks

 ### Connection Management:

- Handles invitation confirmations between clusters
- Maintains HTTP client connections with proper timeouts and transport settings
- Supports connection state listeners for monitoring remote cluster availability
- Implements ping mechanism to verify remote cluster health

 ### Core Features:

- Topic-based message routing
- File transfer capabilities
- Profile image synchronization
- Invitation system for establishing connections
- Health monitoring via pings
- Concurrent message processing
- Connection state management

This package is designed to be thread-safe and handles leadership changes in clustered environments, only running active operations on the leader node.
