# ADR-001: Layered Architecture Implementation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-06-11  
**Deciders:** Mattermost Architecture Team  
**Technical Story:** Implementation of three-tier layered architecture for scalability and maintainability

## Context and Problem Statement

Mattermost requires a scalable architecture that can handle enterprise-level messaging loads while maintaining code maintainability and developer productivity. The system needs to support:

- High-volume real-time messaging
- Plugin ecosystem extensibility  
- Multi-tenant deployments
- Compliance and security requirements
- Database performance optimization

## Decision Drivers

- **Scalability:** Handle 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensibility:** Support plugin architecture
- **Performance:** Sub-100ms message delivery
- **Compliance:** Enterprise security standards

## Considered Options

1. **Monolithic Architecture** - Single deployable unit
2. **Microservices Architecture** - Distributed service mesh
3. **Layered Architecture** - Three-tier separation (chosen)
4. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Message-based communication

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Layered Architecture** with three distinct tiers:

### Layer 1: API Layer (`api4/`)
- RESTful API endpoints
- WebSocket connection management
- Request validation and authentication
- Rate limiting and middleware

### Layer 2: Application Layer (`app/`)
- Business logic implementation
- Service orchestration
- Plugin system management
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching)

### Layer 3: Store Layer (`store/`)
- Data persistence abstraction
- Database interaction logic
- Cache management
- Data validation and integrity

## Positive Consequences

- **Clear Boundaries:** Each layer has well-defined responsibilities
- **Testability:** Layers can be unit tested independently
- **Plugin Support:** Application layer provides stable plugin interfaces
- **Database Flexibility:** Store layer abstracts database specifics
- **Performance Monitoring:** Each layer can be monitored separately

## Negative Consequences

- **Latency Overhead:** Additional abstraction layers
- **Complexity:** More interfaces to maintain
- **Learning Curve:** Developers need to understand layer boundaries

## Implementation Details

### Communication Protocols
### Performance Metrics
- **API Response Time:** < 50ms (95th percentile)
- **Database Query Time:** < 20ms (average)
- **WebSocket Message Latency:** < 100ms
- **Memory Usage:** Linear scaling with concurrent users

### Security Considerations
- Authentication handled at API layer
- Authorization enforced in Application layer
- Data encryption managed in Store layer
- Audit logging across all layers

## Compliance and Standards

- **SOC 2 Type II:** Data handling in Store layer
- **GDPR:** User data management in Application layer
- **HIPAA:** Healthcare messaging compliance
- **Enterprise Security:** Role-based access control
