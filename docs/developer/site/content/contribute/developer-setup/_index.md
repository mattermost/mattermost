Set up your development environment for building, running, and testing Mattermost.

{{<note "Note:">}}
- If you're migrating from before the monorepo see the [migration notes]({{< ref "/contribute/monorepo-migration-notes" >}}).
- If you're developing plugins, see the plugin [developer setup]({{< ref "/integrate/plugins/developer-setup" >}}) documentation.
- If you are forking Mattermost to create a derivative version, you must comply with the AGPLv2 license in both source code and compiled versions and replace the Mattermost name and logo from the system, among other requirements, per the [Mattermost trademark policy](https://mattermost.com/trademark-standards-of-use/).

# Prerequisites for Windows

If you're using Windows, we recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for Mattermost development. Go and Node must be run from within WSL, so you'll need to install them in WSL even if you already have the Windows versions of them installed.

1. [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) by running the following command as an administrator in PowerShell: `wsl --install`
2. [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers#install-docker-desktop) on your Windows machine. Alternatively, you can also [install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) docker engine directly on your linux distribution.
3. Perform the rest of the operations (except Docker installation) within the WSL environment and not in Windows.

# Setup the Mattermost Server

{{<note "Note:">}}
The web app isn't exposed directly, it's exposed via the server. So if both server and web app are running, you can open `localhost:8065`, the server's port to access the web app.
{{</note>}}

1. Install `make`.
    - On Ubuntu, you can install `build essential` tools which will also take care of installing the `make`:

        ```sh
        sudo apt install build-essential
        ```

1. Install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you don't want to use Docker, you can follow [this guide](#develop-mattermost-without-docker).
    - When running `docker` commands under WSL2, if you receive the error `The command 'docker' could not be found in this WSL 2 distro.` you may need to toggle the `Use the WSL 2 based engine` off and on within Docker Settings after installation.
    - Make sure that Docker has virtual file share access to the directory that you will clone the repository in

1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/).
    - Version 1.21 or higher is required.

1. Increase the number of available file descriptors. Update your shell's initialization script (e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`), and add the following:

    ```sh
    ulimit -n 8096
    ```

1. If you don't have it already, install libpng with your preferred package manager.

    - If you are on ARM based Mac, you'll need to install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT211861) to make `libpng` work. Rosetta can be installed by the following command-

        ```sh
        softwareupdate --install-rosetta
        ```

1. Fork https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost.

1. Clone the Mattermost source code from your fork:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/mattermost.git
    ```

1. Install NVM and use it to install the required version of Node.js:

    1. Install {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm" title="NVM" >}} by following {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating" title="these instructions" >}}.

    1. Then, use NVM to install the correct version of Node.js for the Mattermost web app (this should be run within the `webapp` directory):
        ```sh
        nvm install
        ```

1. Start the server:

    ```sh
    cd server
    make run-server
    ```

1. Test your environment to ensure that the server is running:

    ```sh
    curl http://localhost:8065/api/v4/system/ping
    ```

    If successful, the `curl` step will return a JSON object:
    ```json
    {"AndroidLatestVersion":"","AndroidMinVersion":"","DesktopLatestVersion":"","DesktopMinVersion":"","IosLatestVersion":"","IosMinVersion":"","status":"OK"}
    ```

1. Set up up your admin user using mmctl:

   ```sh
   bin/mmctl user create --local --email ADMIN_EMAIL --username ADMIN_USERNAME --password ADMIN_PASSWORD --system-admin
   ```

    - Optionally, you can also populate the database with random sample data as well:

       ```sh
       bin/mmctl sampledata
       ```

1. Start the web app:

    ```sh
    cd webapp
    make run
    ```

1. Open the web app by going to http://localhost:8065 in your browser or by adding it to the Mattermost desktop app.

1. Stop the server:

    ```sh
    make stop-server
    ```

    The `stop-server` make target does not stop all the docker containers started by `run-server`. To stop the running docker containers:

    ```sh
    make stop-docker
    ```

1. Set your options:

    Some behaviors can be customized such as running the server in the foreground as described in the `config.mk` file in the server directory. See that file for details.

# Build the Mattermost Server

The `make package` command will package the application and place it under the `./dist` directory. You can distribute the .tar.gz file if you wish the run the application elsewhere. Note that you would need to run `make build` before this to build the binaries.

# Develop Mattermost without Docker
1. Install `make`.
    - On Ubuntu, you can install `build essential` tools which will also take care of installing the `make`:
        ```sh
        sudo apt install build-essential
        ```
1. Copy the file `server/config.mk` as `server/config.override.mk` and set `MM_NO_DOCKER` to `true` in the copy.
1. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
1. Run `psql postgres`. Then create `mmuser` by running `CREATE ROLE mmuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'mostest';`
1. Modify the role to give rights to create a database by running `ALTER ROLE mmuser CREATEDB;`
1. Confirm the role rights by running `\du`
1. Before creating the database, exit by running `\q`
1. Login again via `mmuser` by running `psql postgres -U mmuser`
1. Create the database by running `CREATE DATABASE mattermost_test;` and exit again with `\q`
1. Login again with `psql postgres` and run `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mattermost_test TO mmuser;` to give all rights to `mmuser`
1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/).
1. Increase the number of available file descriptors. Update your shell's initialization script (e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`), and add the following:
    ```sh
    ulimit -n 8096
    ```

1. If you don't have it already, install libpng with your preferred package manager.
    - If you are on ARM based Mac, you'll need to install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT211861) to make `libpng` work. Rosetta can be installed by the following command-
        ```sh
        softwareupdate --install-rosetta
        ```

1. Fork https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost.
1. Clone the Mattermost source code from your fork:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/mattermost.git
    cd mattermost
    ```

1. Install NVM and use it to install the required version of Node.js:
    - First, install {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm" title="NVM" >}} by following {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating" title="these instructions" >}}.
    - Then, use NVM to install the correct version of Node.js for the Mattermost web app (this should be run within the `webapp` directory):
        ```sh
        cd webapp
        nvm install
        cd ..
        ```
    - NOTE: If you get `zsh: command not found: nvm` when running `nvm install`, you will need to add the following to your ~/.zshrc file:
        ```zsh
        export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
        ```

1. Start the server:
    ```sh
    cd server
    make run-server
    ```

1. Test your environment to ensure that the server is running by running the following in a different terminal session:

    ```sh
    curl -s http://localhost:8065/api/v4/system/ping | jq .
    ```

    If successful, the `curl` step will return a JSON object:
    ```json
    {"AndroidLatestVersion":"","AndroidMinVersion":"","DesktopLatestVersion":"","DesktopMinVersion":"","IosLatestVersion":"","IosMinVersion":"","status":"OK"}
    ```

    Alternately, you can enter `http://localhost:8065/api/v4/system/ping` in a web browser.

1. Set up up your admin user using mmctl:

   ```sh
   bin/mmctl user create --local --email ADMIN_EMAIL --username ADMIN_USERNAME --password ADMIN_PASSWORD --system-admin
   ```

    - Note: `ADMIN_PASSWORD` must be 8 characters or more.

    - Optionally, you can also populate the database with random sample data as well:

       ```sh
       bin/mmctl --local sampledata
       ```

1. Start the web app (in another terminal window):

    ```sh
    cd PATH_TO_MATTERMOST_REPO/webapp
    make run
    ```

1. Open the web app by going to http://localhost:8065 in your browser or by adding it to the Mattermost desktop app.

1. Stop the server:
    ```sh
    cd PATH_TO_MATTERMOST_REPO/server
    make stop-server
    ```

1. Set your options:
    Some behaviors can be customized such as running the server in the foreground as described in the `config.mk` file in the server directory. See that file for details.
