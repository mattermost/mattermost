## Executive Summary
This proposal outlines an architecture to extend the open-source version of Mattermost with scalable search capabilities suitable for enterprise environments with millions of messages. The solution integrates Elasticsearch as a specialized search backend while maintaining compatibility with the existing Mattermost architecture and minimizing changes to the core codebase.

## Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture Limitations
The open-source Mattermost edition uses a SQL database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for both message storage and search functionality. As message volume grows beyond 2-3 million messages, several issues emerge:
- Search operations become increasingly slow and resource-intensive
- Complex queries trigger full table scans, causing high database load
- Text search capabilities in SQL databases lack advanced features like fuzzy matching and relevance scoring

### Proposed Architecture

![Architecture Diagram]

The proposed architecture introduces Elasticsearch as a specialized search engine while maintaining the SQL database as the primary data store:

1. **Dual Storage Model**:
   - SQL Database remains the source of truth for all message data
   - Elasticsearch serves as a secondary, search-optimized index

2. **Components**:
   - **Elasticsearch Cluster**: Distributed search engine for message indexing
   - **Index Service**: New microservice responsible for synchronizing data between SQL and Elasticsearch
   - **Search Adapter**: Plugin/extension to Mattermost that routes search queries to Elasticsearch
   - **Configuration UI**: Admin interface for managing search settings

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Messages continue to be written to SQL database first (maintaining data integrity)
   - Index Service monitors database changes via transaction logs or polling
   - New/modified messages are indexed into Elasticsearch in near real-time
   - Search queries are intercepted and redirected to Elasticsearch
   - Results are returned to users with improved performance

## Technology Choices

### Elasticsearch vs Alternatives

| Feature | Elasticsearch | OpenSearch | Solr | Custom Solution |
|---------|---------------|------------|------|----------------|
| Performance | Excellent | Very Good | Good | Unknown |
| Scalability | Horizontal | Horizontal | Horizontal | Limited |
| Community Support | Strong | Growing | Stable | None |
| Ease of Integration | Good | Good | Moderate | Complex |
| Advanced Features | Rich | Rich | Good | Limited |

**Elasticsearch** was selected for the following reasons:
- Mature technology with proven scalability to billions of documents
- Rich text search capabilities including fuzzy matching, highlighting, and relevance tuning
- Strong community support and extensive documentation
- Well-established integration patterns with various programming languages
- Native support for near real-time indexing and search

### Index Service Implementation

The Index Service will be implemented as a standalone Go microservice responsible for:
- Monitoring SQL database changes via:
  - PostgreSQL logical replication or MySQL binlog for near real-time updates
  - Fallback polling mechanism for databases without change data capture support
- Transforming message data into optimized search documents
- Managing index lifecycle and bulk operations
- Providing health metrics and monitoring endpoints

### Search Adapter Design

The Search Adapter will be implemented as a Mattermost plugin or server extension that:
- Intercepts search API calls
- Translates Mattermost search syntax to Elasticsearch queries
- Handles authentication and access control for search results
- Formats and returns search results in Mattermost's expected format

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Elasticsearch cluster can scale horizontally by adding nodes
- Index Service can be deployed in multiple instances for load distribution
- Separate index shards can be created for different teams or time periods

### Performance Optimization
- Targeted indexing of searchable fields only (message text, file names, etc.)
- Bulk indexing operations for efficient data transfer
- Caching of frequent search queries
- Configurable index refresh intervals to balance search freshness vs. performance

### Resource Requirements

For organizations with approximately 10 million messages:
- Recommended Elasticsearch cluster: 3 nodes (2 data, 1 master)
- Estimated storage: ~20% of original message database size
- RAM requirements: 8-16GB per Elasticsearch node
- Index Service: 1-2 instances with 2-4GB RAM each

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Integration
1. Setup basic Elasticsearch integration
2. Implement Index Service for initial data synchronization
3. Create Search Adapter to redirect basic text queries
4. Add admin configuration options

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Support for advanced search syntax
2. Implement security filtering and access controls
3. Add search analytics and performance monitoring
4. Enable custom analyzers for different languages

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Implement incremental indexing strategies
2. Add index lifecycle management
3. Optimize relevance scoring
4. Create backup and recovery procedures

## Deployment and Maintenance

### Installation Requirements
- Docker containers for Elasticsearch and Index Service
- Configuration options for Mattermost server
- Network connectivity between components

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Index optimization tasks (scheduled)
- Monitoring for synchronization delays
- Version compatibility management
- Index reindexing strategies for schema changes

## Security Considerations
- Elasticsearch access restricted to internal network
- Authentication for Index Service
- Regular security updates
- Encrypted communication between components
- Respect for Mattermost permissions in search results

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a scalable search solution for Mattermost that:
- Maintains data integrity by keeping the SQL database as the source of truth
- Scales horizontally to support millions or even billions of messages
- Improves search performance and capabilities
- Minimizes changes to the core Mattermost codebase
- Offers a path for gradual implementation and testing
