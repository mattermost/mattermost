# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-20)

**Core value:** Full API coverage: every API method and hook available to Go plugins must work identically from Python plugins.
**Current focus:** v1.1 LangChain Agent Demo — Demonstrate Python ecosystem advantages

## Current Position

Phase: 14 of 18 (Bot Infrastructure)
Plan: 1 of 1 complete
Status: Phase 14 complete
Last activity: 2026-01-20 — Completed 14-01-PLAN.md (Bot Infrastructure)

Progress: ██░░░░░░░░ 20% (1/5 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 41 (across 13 phases)
- Average duration: ~11 min
- Total execution time: ~8 hours
- Timeline: 5 days (2026-01-16 → 2026-01-20)

**v1.1 Velocity:**
- Plans completed: 1
- Phase 14-01: 2 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Bot membership lookup for DM routing | 14-01 | More reliable than parsing channel name |
| ensure_bot_user for bot creation | 14-01 | Idempotent - returns existing bot if present |

### Deferred Issues

| Issue | Phase | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Streaming for UploadData/InstallPlugin | 02-04 | Currently unary with bytes; should be client-streaming for large files |
| Performance parity with Go | — | Inherent Python overhead; documented, not a blocker |

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Session Continuity

## Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 12 added: Python API Callback Server (2026-01-20)
  - Reason: During real-world testing, discovered Python plugins cannot call back to Go API

- Phase 13 added: Python Plugin Developer Experience (2026-01-20)
  - Final phase before milestone completion
  - Focus: Architecture docs, Makefile tooling, Claude.md guides for agentic AI development

- Milestone v1.1 created: LangChain Agent Demo, 5 phases (Phase 14-18) (2026-01-20)
  - Focus: Demonstrate Python ecosystem advantages with LangChain AI agent plugin

## Next Steps

**Phase 15: LangChain Integration** — Replace placeholder handlers with actual LangChain/LLM calls

Options:
- `/gsd:plan-phase 15` — Create detailed execution plan
- `/gsd:execute-phase 15` — Execute existing plan (if one exists)
