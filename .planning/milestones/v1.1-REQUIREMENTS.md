## v1.1 LangChain Agent Demo: Requirements

### Validated

- [x] Python SDK fully functional from v1.0 — v1.1
- [x] Dual AI bot infrastructure (OpenAI and Anthropic) — v1.1
- [x] LangChain integration with real LLM responses — v1.1
- [x] Multi-turn conversation support via Mattermost threading — v1.1
- [x] Model Context Protocol (MCP) client for tool access — v1.1
- [x] Agentic loop with recursion limiting — v1.1
- [x] Extended thinking support (Anthropic) — v1.1
- [x] Retry logic with exponential backoff — v1.1
- [x] Graceful degradation (missing API keys, no MCP) — v1.1

### Traceability

| Requirement | Status | Phase | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Dual AI bot infrastructure | Complete | 14-01 | Uses `ensure_bot_user()` for idempotent creation |
| LangChain integration | Complete | 15-01 | Both OpenAI and Anthropic models tested |
| Model initialization | Complete | 15-01 | Graceful error handling when API keys missing |
| Conversation history | Complete | 16-01 | Via threading; uses get_post_thread() for context |
| MCP client | Complete | 17-01 | HTTP/SSE and STDIO servers supported |
| Agentic loop | Complete | 18-01 | ReAct pattern with 10-iteration limit |
| Extended thinking | Complete | 18-01 | Anthropic 2000-token budget, 5000-token response limit |
| Retry logic | Complete | 18-01 | Tenacity configured for transient errors only |
| Fallback behavior | Complete | 17-01 | Falls back to basic model.invoke() without MCP |

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 9 of 9 v1.1 requirements
**Adjusted:** None (all requirements shipped as specified)
**Dropped:** None

### Requirements That Changed During Implementation

None. All requirements shipped as originally defined in v1.1 planning.

### Key Observations

1. **Ecosystem Leverage:** v1.1 built entirely on v1.0 foundation. Zero rework of underlying gRPC/SDK needed.
2. **Graceful Degradation:** Design pattern of graceful fallbacks (API keys, MCP) significantly improved robustness.
3. **Threading as History:** Mattermost threading provided elegant conversation history without additional storage.
4. **Extended Thinking:** Anthropic extended thinking proved valuable for complex reasoning tasks.
