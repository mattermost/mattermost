Implement comprehensive security hardening with defense-in-depth strategy through coordinated multi-agent orchestration:

[Extended thinking: This workflow implements a defense-in-depth security strategy across all application layers. It coordinates specialized security agents to perform comprehensive assessments, implement layered security controls, and establish continuous security monitoring. The approach follows modern DevSecOps principles with shift-left security, automated scanning, and compliance validation. Each phase builds upon previous findings to create a resilient security posture that addresses both current vulnerabilities and future threats.]

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Security Assessment

Evaluate service boundaries, data flow security, authentication/authorization architecture, encryption implementation, network segmentation. Design zero-trust architecture patterns. Reference threat model and vulnerability findings."
- Output: Security architecture assessment, zero-trust design recommendations, service mesh security requirements, data classification matrix
- Context: Incorporates threat model to address architectural vulnerabilities

## Phase 2: Vulnerability Remediation

### 4. Critical Vulnerability Fixes
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="security-auditor"

- Prompt: "Implement comprehensive backend security controls for: $ARGUMENTS. Add input validation with OWASP ESAPI, implement rate limiting and DDoS protection, secure API endpoints with OAuth2/JWT validation, add encryption for data at rest/transit using AES-256/TLS 1.3. Implement secure logging without PII exposure."
- Output: Hardened API endpoints, validation middleware, encryption implementation, secure configuration templates
- Context: Builds upon vulnerability fixes with preventive controls

### 6. Frontend Security Implementation
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-mobile-security::frontend-security-coder"
- Prompt: "Implement frontend security measures for: $ARGUMENTS. Configure CSP headers with nonce-based policies, implement XSS prevention with DOMPurify, secure authentication flows with PKCE OAuth2, add SRI for external resources, implement secure cookie handling with SameSite/HttpOnly/Secure flags."
- Output: Secure frontend components, CSP policy configuration, authentication flow implementation, security headers configuration
- Context: Complements backend security with client-side protections

### 7. Mobile Security Hardening
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-mobile-security::mobile-security-coder"
- Prompt: "Implement mobile app security for: $ARGUMENTS. Add certificate pinning, implement biometric authentication, secure local storage with encryption, obfuscate code with ProGuard/R8, implement anti-tampering and root/jailbreak detection, secure IPC communications."
- Output: Hardened mobile application, security configuration files, obfuscation rules, certificate pinning implementation
- Context: Extends security to mobile platforms if applicable

## Phase 3: Security Controls Implementation

### 8. Authentication and Authorization Enhancement
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="security-auditor"
- Prompt: "Implement modern authentication system for: $ARGUMENTS. Deploy OAuth2/OIDC with PKCE, implement MFA with TOTP/WebAuthn/FIDO2, add risk-based authentication, implement RBAC/ABAC with principle of least privilege, add session management with secure token rotation."
- Output: Authentication service configuration, MFA implementation, authorization policies, session management system
- Context: Strengthens access controls based on architecture review

### 9. Infrastructure Security Controls
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="deployment-strategies::deployment-engineer"
