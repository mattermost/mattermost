# Intelligent Issue Resolution with Multi-Agent Orchestration

[Extended thinking: This workflow implements a sophisticated debugging and resolution pipeline that leverages AI-assisted debugging tools and observability platforms to systematically diagnose and resolve production issues. The intelligent debugging strategy combines automated root cause analysis with human expertise, using modern 2024/2025 practices including AI code assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code), observability platforms (Sentry, DataDog, OpenTelemetry), git bisect automation for regression tracking, and production-safe debugging techniques like distributed tracing and structured logging. The process follows a rigorous four-phase approach: (1) Issue Analysis Phase - error-detective and debugger agents analyze error traces, logs, reproduction steps, and observability data to understand the full context of the failure including upstream/downstream impacts, (2) Root Cause Investigation Phase - debugger and code-reviewer agents perform deep code analysis, automated git bisect to identify introducing commit, dependency compatibility checks, and state inspection to isolate the exact failure mechanism, (3) Fix Implementation Phase - domain-specific agents (python-pro, typescript-pro, rust-expert, etc.) implement minimal fixes with comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and edge case tests while following production-safe practices, (4) Verification Phase - test-automator and performance-engineer agents run regression suites, performance benchmarks, security scans, and verify no new issues are introduced. Complex issues spanning multiple systems require orchestrated coordination between specialist agents (database-optimizer → performance-engineer → devops-troubleshooter) with explicit context passing and state sharing. The workflow emphasizes understanding root causes over treating symptoms, implementing lasting architectural improvements, automating detection through enhanced monitoring and alerting, and preventing future occurrences through type system enhancements, static analysis rules, and improved error handling patterns. Success is measured not just by issue resolution but by reduced mean time to recovery (MTTR), prevention of similar issues, and improved system resilience.]

## Phase 1: Issue Analysis - Error Detection and Context Gathering

Use Task tool with subagent_type="error-debugging::error-detective" followed by subagent_type="error-debugging::debugger":

**First: Error-Detective Analysis**

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze error traces, logs, and observability data for: $ARGUMENTS

Deliverables:
1. Error signature analysis: exception type, message patterns, frequency, first occurrence
2. Stack trace deep dive: failure location, call chain, involved components
3. Reproduction steps: minimal test case, environment requirements, data fixtures needed
4. Observability context:
   - Sentry/DataDog error groups and trends
   - Distributed traces showing request flow (OpenTelemetry/Jaeger)
   - Structured logs (JSON logs with correlation IDs)
   - APM metrics: latency spikes, error rates, resource usage
5. User impact assessment: affected user segments, error rate, business metrics impact
6. Timeline analysis: when did it start, correlation with deployments/config changes
7. Related symptoms: similar errors, cascading failures, upstream/downstream impacts

Modern debugging techniques to employ:
- AI-assisted log analysis (pattern detection, anomaly identification)
- Distributed trace correlation across microservices
- Production-safe debugging (no code changes, use observability data)
- Error fingerprinting for deduplication and tracking
```

**Expected output:**
```
ERROR_SIGNATURE: {exception type + key message pattern}
FREQUENCY: {count, rate, trend}
FIRST_SEEN: {timestamp or git commit}
STACK_TRACE: {formatted trace with key frames highlighted}
REPRODUCTION: {minimal steps + sample data}

USER_IMPACT: {affected users, severity, business impact}
TIMELINE: {when started, correlation with changes}
RELATED_ISSUES: [similar errors, cascading failures]
```

**Second: Debugger Root Cause Identification**

**Prompt:**

2. Code-level analysis: variable states, control flow, timing issues
3. Git bisect analysis: identify introducing commit (automate with git bisect run)
4. Dependency analysis: version conflicts, API changes, configuration drift
5. State inspection: database state, cache state, external API responses
6. Failure mechanism: why does the code fail under these specific conditions
7. Fix strategy options with tradeoffs (quick fix vs proper fix)

Context needed for next phase:
- Exact file paths and line numbers requiring changes
- Data structures or API contracts affected
- Dependencies that may need updates
- Test scenarios to verify the fix
- Performance characteristics to maintain
```

**Expected output:**
```

2. Variable state tracking: values at key decision points
3. Control flow analysis: branches taken, loops, async operations
4. Git bisect automation: create bisect script to identify exact breaking commit
   ```bash
   git bisect start HEAD v1.2.3
   git bisect run ./test_reproduction.sh
   ```
5. Dependency compatibility matrix: version combinations that work/fail
6. Configuration analysis: environment variables, feature flags, deployment configs
7. Timing and race condition analysis: async operations, event ordering, locks
8. Memory and resource analysis: leaks, exhaustion, contention

Modern investigation techniques:
- AI-assisted code explanation (Claude/Copilot to understand complex logic)
- Automated git bisect with reproduction test
- Dependency graph analysis (npm ls, go mod graph, pip show)
- Configuration drift detection (compare staging vs production)
- Time-travel debugging using production traces
```

**Expected output:**
```
CODE_PATH: {entry → ... → failure location with key variables}
STATE_AT_FAILURE: {variable values, object states, database state}

3. Error handling review: missing try-catch, unhandled promises, panic scenarios
4. Contract validation: input validation gaps, output guarantees not met
5. Architectural issues: tight coupling, missing abstractions, layering violations
6. Similar patterns: other code locations with same vulnerability
7. Fix design: minimal change vs refactoring vs architectural improvement

Review checklist:
- Are null/undefined values handled correctly?
- Are async operations properly awaited/chained?
- Are error cases explicitly handled?
- Are type assertions safe?
- Are API contracts respected?
- Are side effects isolated?
```

**Expected output:**

## Multi-Domain Coordination for Complex Issues

For issues spanning multiple domains, orchestrate specialized agents sequentially with explicit context passing:

**Example 1: Database Performance Issue Causing Application Timeouts**

**Sequence:**
1. **Phase 1-2**: error-detective + debugger identify slow database queries
2. **Phase 3a**: Task(subagent_type="database-cloud-optimization::database-optimizer")
   - Optimize query with proper indexes
   - Context: "Query execution taking 5s, missing index on user_id column, N+1 query pattern detected"

   - Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Context: "Database query optimized from 5s to 50ms by adding index on user_id column. Application still experiencing 2s response times due to N+1 query pattern loading 100+ user records per request. Add Redis caching with 5-minute TTL for user profiles."
4. **Phase 3c**: Task(subagent_type="incident-response::devops-troubleshooter")
   - Configure monitoring for query performance and cache hit rates
   - Context: "Cache layer added with Redis. Need monitoring for: query p95 latency (threshold: 100ms), cache hit rate (threshold: >80%), cache memory usage (alert at 80%)."

**Example 2: Frontend JavaScript Error in Production**

**Sequence:**
1. **Phase 1**: error-detective analyzes Sentry error reports

   - Fix frontend with proper null checks
   - Add type guards
   - Context: "Backend API /api/users endpoint returning null instead of [] when no results. Fix frontend to handle both. Add TypeScript strict null checks."
4. **Phase 3b**: Task(subagent_type="backend-development::backend-architect")
   - Fix backend to always return array
   - Update API contract
   - Context: "Frontend now handles null, but API should follow contract and return [] not null. Update OpenAPI spec to document this."
5. **Phase 4**: test-automator runs cross-browser tests
6. **Phase 5**: code-reviewer documents API contract changes

**Example 3: Security Vulnerability in Authentication**

**Sequence:**
1. **Phase 1**: error-detective reviews security scan report
   - Context: "SQL injection vulnerability in login endpoint, Snyk severity: HIGH"
2. **Phase 2**: debugger + security-auditor investigate
   - Context: "User input not sanitized in SQL WHERE clause, allows authentication bypass"
3. **Phase 3**: Task(subagent_type="security-scanning::security-auditor")
   - Implement parameterized queries
   - Add input validation
   - Add rate limiting
   - Context: "Replace string concatenation with prepared statements. Add input validation for email format. Implement rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 min)."
4. **Phase 4a**: test-automator adds security tests
   - SQL injection attempts
   - Brute force scenarios
5. **Phase 4b**: security-auditor performs penetration testing
6. **Phase 5**: code-reviewer documents security improvements and creates postmortem

- OWASP ZAP (security testing)
- Semgrep (custom security rules)
- npm audit / pip-audit / cargo audit

## Success Criteria

A fix is considered complete when ALL of the following are met:

**Root Cause Understanding:**
- Root cause is identified with supporting evidence
- Failure mechanism is clearly documented
- Introducing commit identified (if applicable via git bisect)
- Similar vulnerabilities catalogued

**Fix Quality:**
- Fix addresses root cause, not just symptoms
- Minimal code changes (avoid over-engineering)
- Follows project conventions and patterns
- No code smells or anti-patterns introduced
- Backward compatibility maintained (or breaking changes documented)

**Testing Verification:**
- All existing tests pass (zero regressions)
- New tests cover the specific bug reproduction
- Edge cases and error paths tested
- Integration tests verify end-to-end behavior
- Test coverage increased (or maintained at high level)

**Performance & Security:**
- No performance degradation (p95 latency within 5% of baseline)
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Resource usage acceptable (memory, CPU, I/O)
- Load testing passed for high-traffic changes

**Deployment Readiness:**
- Code review approved by domain expert
- Rollback plan documented and tested
- Feature flags configured (if applicable)
- Monitoring and alerting configured
- Runbook updated with troubleshooting steps

**Prevention Measures:**
- Static analysis rules added (if applicable)
- Type system improvements implemented (if applicable)
- Documentation updated (code, API, runbook)
- Postmortem created (if high-severity incident)
- Knowledge base article created (if novel issue)

**Metrics:**
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): < 4 hours for SEV2+
- Bug recurrence rate: 0% (same root cause should not recur)
- Test coverage: No decrease, ideally increase
- Deployment success rate: > 95% (rollback rate < 5%)
