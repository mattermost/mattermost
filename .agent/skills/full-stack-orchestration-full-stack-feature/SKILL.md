Orchestrate full-stack feature development across backend, frontend, and infrastructure layers with modern API-first approach:

[Extended thinking: This workflow coordinates multiple specialized agents to deliver a complete full-stack feature from architecture through deployment. It follows API-first development principles, ensuring contract-driven development where the API specification drives both backend implementation and frontend consumption. Each phase builds upon previous outputs, creating a cohesive system with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, and production-ready deployment. The workflow emphasizes modern practices like component-driven UI development, feature flags, observability, and progressive rollout strategies.]

## Phase 1: Architecture & Design Foundation

### 1. Database Architecture Design

Based on the API contracts from previous step, design component hierarchy, state management approach (Redux/Zustand/Context), routing structure, and data fetching patterns. Include accessibility requirements and responsive design strategy. Plan for Storybook component documentation."
- Expected output: Component tree diagram, state management design, routing configuration, design system integration plan, accessibility checklist
- Context: API specifications from step 2, UI/UX requirements

## Phase 2: Parallel Implementation

### 4. Backend Service Implementation

Implement business logic, data access layer, authentication middleware, and integration with external services. Include observability (structured logging, metrics, tracing)."
- Expected output: Backend service code, API endpoints, middleware, background jobs, unit tests, integration tests
- Context: Architecture designs from Phase 1, database schema

### 5. Frontend Implementation
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-mobile-development::frontend-developer"
- Prompt: "Implement frontend application for: $ARGUMENTS. Build React/Next.js components using the component architecture from Phase 1. Implement state management, API integration with proper error handling and loading states, form validation, and responsive layouts. Create Storybook stories for components. Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)."
- Expected output: React components, state management implementation, API client code, Storybook stories, responsive styles, accessibility implementations
- Context: Component architecture from step 3, API contracts

### 6. Database Implementation & Optimization
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="database-design::sql-pro"
- Prompt: "Implement and optimize database layer for: $ARGUMENTS. Create migration scripts, stored procedures (if needed), optimize queries identified by backend implementation, set up proper indexes, and implement data validation constraints. Include database-level security measures and backup strategies."
- Expected output: Migration scripts, optimized queries, stored procedures, index definitions, database security configuration
- Context: Database design from step 1, query patterns from backend implementation

## Phase 3: Integration & Testing

### 7. API Contract Testing
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="test-automator"
- Prompt: "Create contract tests for: $ARGUMENTS. Implement Pact/Dredd tests to validate API contracts between backend and frontend. Create integration tests for all API endpoints, test authentication flows, validate error responses, and ensure proper CORS configuration. Include load testing scenarios."
- Expected output: Contract test suites, integration tests, load test scenarios, API documentation validation
- Context: API implementations from Phase 2

### 8. End-to-End Testing
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="test-automator"
- Prompt: "Implement E2E tests for: $ARGUMENTS. Create Playwright/Cypress tests covering critical user journeys, cross-browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, and error scenarios. Test feature flags integration, analytics tracking, and performance metrics. Include visual regression tests."
- Expected output: E2E test suites, visual regression baselines, performance benchmarks, test reports
- Context: Frontend and backend implementations from Phase 2

### 9. Security Audit & Hardening
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="security-auditor"
- Prompt: "Perform security audit for: $ARGUMENTS. Review API security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting), check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, audit frontend for XSS/CSRF risks, validate input sanitization, and review secrets management. Provide penetration testing results and remediation steps."
- Expected output: Security audit report, vulnerability assessment, remediation recommendations, security headers configuration
- Context: All implementations from Phase 2

## Phase 4: Deployment & Operations

### 10. Infrastructure & CI/CD Setup
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="deployment-engineer"
- Prompt: "Setup deployment infrastructure for: $ARGUMENTS. Create Docker containers, Kubernetes manifests (or cloud-specific configs), implement CI/CD pipelines with automated testing gates, setup feature flags (LaunchDarkly/Unleash), and configure monitoring/alerting. Include blue-green deployment strategy and rollback procedures."
- Expected output: Dockerfiles, K8s manifests, CI/CD pipeline configs, feature flag setup, IaC templates (Terraform/CloudFormation)

### 11. Observability & Monitoring
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="deployment-engineer"
- Prompt: "Implement observability stack for: $ARGUMENTS.

- Maintain traceability between requirements and implementations
- Use correlation IDs across all services for distributed tracing
- Document all architectural decisions in ADRs
- Ensure consistent error handling and API responses across services
