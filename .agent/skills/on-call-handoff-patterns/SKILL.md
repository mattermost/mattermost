# On-Call Handoff Patterns

Effective patterns for on-call shift transitions, ensuring continuity, context transfer, and reliable incident response across shifts.

## When to Use This Skill

- Transitioning on-call responsibilities
- Writing shift handoff summaries
- Documenting ongoing investigations
- Establishing on-call rotation procedures
- Improving handoff quality
- Onboarding new on-call engineers

## Core Concepts

### 1. Handoff Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Active Incidents** | What's currently broken |
| **Ongoing Investigations** | Issues being debugged |
| **Recent Changes** | Deployments, configs |
| **Known Issues** | Workarounds in place |
| **Upcoming Events** | Maintenance, releases |

### 2. Handoff Timing

```
Recommended: 30 min overlap between shifts

Outgoing:
├── 15 min: Write handoff document
└── 15 min: Sync call with incoming

Incoming:
├── 15 min: Review handoff document
├── 15 min: Sync call with outgoing
└── 5 min: Verify alerting setup
```

## Templates

### Template 1: Shift Handoff Document

```markdown
# On-Call Handoff: Platform Team

**Outgoing**: @alice (2024-01-15 to 2024-01-22)
**Incoming**: @bob (2024-01-22 to 2024-01-29)
**Handoff Time**: 2024-01-22 09:00 UTC

## 🔴 Active Incidents

### None currently active
No active incidents at handoff time.

## 🟡 Ongoing Investigations

### 1. Intermittent API Timeouts (ENG-1234)
**Status**: Investigating
**Started**: 2024-01-20
**Impact**: ~0.1% of requests timing out

**Context**:
- Timeouts correlate with database backup window (02:00-03:00 UTC)
- Suspect backup process causing lock contention
- Added extra logging in PR #567 (deployed 01/21)

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Review new logs after tonight's backup
- [ ] Consider moving backup window if confirmed

**Resources**:
- Dashboard: [API Latency](https://grafana/d/api-latency)
- Thread: #platform-eng (01/20, 14:32)

---

### 2. Memory Growth in Auth Service (ENG-1235)
**Status**: Monitoring
**Started**: 2024-01-18
**Impact**: None yet (proactive)

**Context**:
- Memory usage growing ~5% per day
- No memory leak found in profiling
- Suspect connection pool not releasing properly

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Review heap dump from 01/21
- [ ] Consider restart if usage > 80%

**Resources**:
- Dashboard: [Auth Service Memory](https://grafana/d/auth-memory)
- Analysis doc: [Memory Investigation](https://docs/eng-1235)

## 🟢 Resolved This Shift

### Payment Service Outage (2024-01-19)
- **Duration**: 23 minutes
- **Root Cause**: Database connection exhaustion
- **Resolution**: Rolled back v2.3.4, increased pool size
- **Postmortem**: [POSTMORTEM-89](https://docs/postmortem-89)
- **Follow-up tickets**: ENG-1230, ENG-1231

**Ticket**: OPS-456 (P3)

### 2. Flaky Integration Test
**Issue**: `test_payment_flow` fails intermittently in CI
**Workaround**: Re-run failed job (usually passes on retry)
**Ticket**: ENG-1200 (P2)

### Template 3: Incident Handoff (Mid-Incident)

```markdown
# INCIDENT HANDOFF: Payment Service Degradation

**Incident Start**: 2024-01-22 08:15 UTC
**Current Status**: Mitigating
**Severity**: SEV2

---

## Current State
- Error rate: 15% (down from 40%)
- Mitigation in progress: scaling up pods
- ETA to resolution: ~30 min

## What We Know
1. Root cause: Memory pressure on payment-service pods
2. Triggered by: Unusual traffic spike (3x normal)
3. Contributing: Inefficient query in checkout flow

## What We've Done
- Scaled payment-service from 5 → 15 pods
- Enabled rate limiting on checkout endpoint
- Disabled non-critical features

## What Needs to Happen
1. Monitor error rate - should reach <1% in ~15 min
2. If not improving, escalate to @payments-manager
3. Once stable, begin root cause investigation

## Key People
- Incident Commander: @alice (handing off)
- Comms Lead: @charlie
- Technical Lead: @bob (incoming)

## Communication

```

### During Your Shift

```markdown

- [ ] Review dashboards for anomalies
- [ ] Check for any P0/P1 tickets created
- [ ] Skim incident channels for context

- [ ] Verify PagerDuty routing changed
- [ ] Close/update investigation tickets
- [ ] File postmortems for any incidents
- [ ] Take time off if shift was stressful
```

## Escalation Guidelines

### When to Escalate

```markdown
## Escalation Triggers

### Immediate Escalation
- SEV1 incident declared
- Data breach suspected
- Unable to diagnose within 30 min
- Customer or legal escalation received

### Consider Escalation
- Issue spans multiple teams
- Requires expertise you don't have
- Business impact exceeds threshold
- You're uncertain about next steps

### How to Escalate
1. Page the appropriate escalation path
2. Provide brief context in Slack
3. Stay engaged until escalation acknowledges
4. Hand off cleanly, don't just disappear
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Document everything** - Future you will thank you
- **Escalate early** - Better safe than sorry
- **Take breaks** - Alert fatigue is real
- **Keep handoffs synchronous** - Async loses context
- **Test your setup** - Before incidents, not during

### Don'ts
- **Don't skip handoffs** - Context loss causes incidents
- **Don't hero** - Escalate when needed
- **Don't ignore alerts** - Even if they seem minor
- **Don't work sick** - Swap shifts instead
- **Don't disappear** - Stay reachable during shift
