# Track Manager

Manage the complete track lifecycle including archiving, restoring, deleting, renaming, and cleaning up orphaned artifacts.

## Pre-flight Checks

1. Verify Conductor is initialized:
   - Check `conductor/product.md` exists
   - Check `conductor/tracks.md` exists
   - Check `conductor/tracks/` directory exists
   - If missing: Display error and suggest running `/conductor:setup` first

2. Ensure archive directory exists (for archive/restore operations):
   - Check if `conductor/tracks/_archive/` exists
   - Create if needed when performing archive operation

## Mode Detection

Parse arguments to determine operation mode:

| Argument               | Mode         | Description                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--list [filter]`      | List         | Show all tracks (optional: active, completed, archived) |
| `--archive <id>`       | Archive      | Move completed track to archive                         |
| `--archive --bulk`     | Bulk Archive | Multi-select completed tracks                           |
| `--restore <id>`       | Restore      | Restore archived track to active                        |
| `--delete <id>`        | Delete       | Permanently remove a track                              |
| `--rename <old> <new>` | Rename       | Change track ID                                         |
| `--cleanup`            | Cleanup      | Detect and fix orphaned artifacts                       |
| (none)                 | Interactive  | Menu-driven operation selection                         |

## List Mode (`--list`)

Display comprehensive track overview with optional filtering.

### 1. Data Collection

**For Active Tracks:**

- Read `conductor/tracks.md`
- For each track with status `[ ]` or `[~]`:
  - Read `conductor/tracks/{trackId}/metadata.json` for type, dates
  - Read `conductor/tracks/{trackId}/plan.md` for task counts
  - Calculate progress percentage

**For Completed Tracks:**

- Find tracks with status `[x]` not in `_archive/`
- Read metadata for completion dates

**For Archived Tracks:**

- Scan `conductor/tracks/_archive/` directory
- Read each `metadata.json` for archive reason and date

### 2. Output Format

**Full list (no filter):**

## Archive Mode (`--archive`)

Move completed tracks to the archive directory.

### With Argument (`--archive <track-id>`)

#### 1. Validate Track

- Check track exists in `conductor/tracks/{track-id}/`
- If not found, display error with available tracks:

  ```
  ERROR: Track not found: {track-id}

  Available tracks:
  - auth_20250110 (completed)
  - dashboard_20250112 (in progress)

  Usage: /conductor:manage --archive <track-id>
  ```

- Check track is not already archived (not in `_archive/`)
- If archived:

  ```
  ERROR: Track '{track-id}' is already archived.

  Archived: {archived_at}
  Reason:   {archive_reason}
  Location: conductor/tracks/_archive/{track-id}/

  To restore: /conductor:manage --restore {track-id}
  ```

#### 2. Verify Completion Status

Read `conductor/tracks/{track-id}/metadata.json` and `plan.md`:

- If status is not `completed` or `[x]`:

  ```
  Track '{track-id}' is not marked as complete.

  Current status: {status}
  Tasks: {completed}/{total} complete

  Options:
  1. Archive anyway (not recommended)
  2. Cancel and complete the track first
  3. View track status

  Select option:
  ```

- If option 1 selected, proceed with warning
- If option 2 or 3 selected, exit or show status

#### 3. Prompt for Archive Reason

```
Why are you archiving this track?

1. Completed - Work finished successfully
2. Superseded - Replaced by another track
3. Abandoned - No longer needed
4. Other (specify)

Select reason:
```

If "Other" selected, prompt for custom reason.

## Cleanup Mode (`--cleanup`)

Detect and fix orphaned track artifacts.

### 1. Scan for Issues

**Directory Orphans:**

- Scan `conductor/tracks/` for directories
- Check each against tracks.md entries
- Flag directories not in registry

**Registry Orphans:**

- Parse tracks.md for all track entries
- Check each has a corresponding directory
- Flag entries without directories

**Incomplete Tracks:**

- For each track directory, verify required files exist:
  - `spec.md`
  - `plan.md`
  - `metadata.json`
- Flag tracks missing required files

**Stale In-Progress:**

- Find tracks with status `[~]`
- Check `metadata.json` `updated` timestamp
- Flag if untouched for > 7 days

## Error Handling

### Git Operation Failures

```
GIT ERROR: {error message}

The operation partially completed:
- Directory moved: Yes/No
- tracks.md updated: Yes/No
- Commit created: No

You may need to manually:
1. Complete the git commit
2. Restore files from their current locations

Current state:
- Track location: {path}
- tracks.md: {status}

To retry the commit:
  git add conductor/tracks.md conductor/tracks/{track-id}
  git commit -m "{intended message}"
```

### File System Errors

```
ERROR: Failed to {operation}: {error}

Possible causes:
- Permission denied
- Disk full
- File in use

No changes were made. Please resolve the issue and try again.
```

### Invalid Arguments

```
ERROR: Invalid argument: {argument}

Usage: /conductor:manage [--archive | --restore | --delete | --rename | --list | --cleanup]

Examples:
  /conductor:manage                     # Interactive mode
  /conductor:manage --list              # List all tracks
  /conductor:manage --list archived     # List archived tracks only
  /conductor:manage --archive track-id  # Archive specific track
  /conductor:manage --restore track-id  # Restore archived track
  /conductor:manage --delete track-id   # Delete track permanently
  /conductor:manage --rename old new    # Rename track ID
  /conductor:manage --cleanup           # Fix orphaned artifacts
```

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS verify track existence** before any operation
2. **REQUIRE explicit confirmation** for destructive operations:
   - 'YES' for archive, restore, rename
   - 'DELETE' for permanent deletion
3. **HALT on any error** - Do not attempt to continue past failures
4. **UPDATE tracks.md** - Keep registry in sync with file system
5. **COMMIT changes** - Create git commits for traceability
6. **PRESERVE history** - Git commits are never modified or deleted
7. **WARN for in-progress** - Extra caution when modifying active work
8. **OFFER alternatives** - Suggest archive before delete
