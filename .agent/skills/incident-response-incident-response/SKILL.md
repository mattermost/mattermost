Orchestrate multi-agent incident response with modern SRE practices for rapid resolution and learning:

[Extended thinking: This workflow implements a comprehensive incident command system (ICS) following modern SRE principles. Multiple specialized agents collaborate through defined phases: detection/triage, investigation/mitigation, communication/coordination, and resolution/postmortem. The workflow emphasizes speed without sacrificing accuracy, maintains clear communication channels, and ensures every incident becomes a learning opportunity through blameless postmortems and systematic improvements.]

## Configuration

### Severity Levels
- **P0/SEV-1**: Complete outage, security breach, data loss - immediate all-hands response
- **P1/SEV-2**: Major degradation, significant user impact - rapid response required
- **P2/SEV-3**: Minor degradation, limited impact - standard response
- **P3/SEV-4**: Cosmetic issues, no user impact - scheduled resolution

### Incident Types
- Performance degradation
- Service outage
- Security incident

## Phase 3: Resolution & Recovery

### 7. Fix Implementation
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="backend-development::backend-architect"
- Prompt: "Design and implement production fix for incident: $ARGUMENTS based on root cause. Requirements: 1) Minimal viable fix for rapid deployment, 2) Risk assessment and rollback capability, 3) Staged rollout plan with monitoring, 4) Validation criteria and health checks. Consider both immediate fix and long-term solution."
- Output: Fix implementation, deployment strategy, validation plan, rollback procedures
- Context: Root cause analysis, performance findings, security assessment

### 8. Deployment and Validation
