# mattermost-redux

This package contains a large part of the [Redux](http://redux.js.org) code and some utilities used by [the Mattermost web app](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/webapp/channels) for usage in Mattermost plugins and other related projects.

This code doesn't strictly follow semantic versioning as it is mostly internal code to Mattermost, and it will feature breaking changes outside of major releases, but it can be considered stable for the most part.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install mattermost-redux @mattermost/types @mattermost/client
```
