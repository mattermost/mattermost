/*
  Sorts dependencies between chunks by their "parents" attribute.

  This function sorts chunks based on their dependencies with each other.
  The parent relation between chunks as generated by Webpack for each chunk
  is used to define a directed (and hopefully acyclic) graph, which is then
  topologically sorted in order to retrieve the correct order in which
  chunks need to be embedded into HTML. A directed edge in this graph is
  describing a "is parent of" relationship from a chunk to another (distinct)
  chunk. Thus topological sorting orders chunks from bottom-layer chunks to
  highest level chunks that use the lower-level chunks.

  @param {Array} chunks an array of chunks as generated by the html-webpack-plugin.
  It is assumed that each entry contains at least the properties "id"
  (containing the chunk id) and "parents" (array containing the ids of the
  parent chunks).

  @return {Array} A topologically sorted version of the input chunks
