## Writing Themed Components

### Using Theme Colors

Theme colors are applied using CSS variables set on the root of the document. Every theme color has two corresponding CSS variables: one with the full color value (eg. `--button-bg`) and another that has an `-rgb` suffix which is split into its RGB components (eg. `--button-bg-rgb`). The regular version should be used for colors that are fully opaque, and the RGB version with the suffix should be used when for translucent colors.

```css
:root {
    --button-bg: #1c58d9,
    --button-color: #ffffff,

    --button-bg-rgb: 28, 88, 217;
    --button-color-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
}

.SomeButton {
    background-color: var(--button-bg);
    color: var(--button-color);
}

.SomeButton:disabled {
    background-color: rgba(var(--button-bg-rgb), 0.7);
    color: rgba(var(--button-color), 0.7);
}
```

### Testing Themed Components

When testing themed components, make sure to:

1. **Test all themes**: Check your component with both light and dark themes to make sure it appears correctly in both.
2. **Check contrast**: Ensure text is readable in all themes.
3. **Check all interactive states**: Verify focus, hover, and active states appear correctly across all themes.

### Troubleshooting

#### Theme not applying?
- Check that your component uses CSS variables instead of hardcoded colors
- Verify SCSS is compiled correctly

#### Theme applying where it shouldn't?
- Ensure styles are properly scoped under `.app__body`

#### Colors look wrong?
- Check for hard-coded colors overriding theme variables
- Verify opacity calculations use RGB variables
- Test with browser DevTools to inspect CSS values to ensure that the correct colors are being applied and that they aren't being overridden

## Using Themes in Storybook

### Changing Themes

You can change themes by clicking on the paintbrush icon (üñåÔ∏è) in the toolbar at the top of Storybook. Your theme selection will persist as you switch stories or refresh Storybook.

You can also change the background color by clicking on the picture icon (üñºÔ∏è) in the toolbar at the top of Storybook to see how your component will look in different parts of the UI.
