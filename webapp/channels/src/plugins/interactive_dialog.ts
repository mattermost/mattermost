// This code is problematic for a couple of different reasons:
// * it monitors the store to modify the store: this is perhaps better handled by a saga
// * it makes importing this file impure by triggering a side-effect which may not be obvious
// * it's not really located in the "right place": dialogs are applicable to non-plugins too
// * it's nigh impossible to test as written
//
// It's worth fixing all of this, but I think this requires some refactoring.
